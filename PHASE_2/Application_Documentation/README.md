### The Adventures of Captain Epidemic

The Adventures of Captain Epidemic is a platform designed for children to learn about diseases in a fun and interactive way. The website contains concise information, simple language and concepts children can understand plus eye-catching graphics and games that still provide up to date accurate information on diseases. We developed our website using React, linked to backend through Express and Node.js and have hosted it on heroku. 

The applications source code can be found in PHASE_2/API_SourceCode. The frontend and backend have been separated into two folders. The frontend folder can be found in PHASE_2/API_SourceCode/seng3011website which is the React app. The backend folder can be found in PHASE_2/API_SourceCode/api which contains the databases and Node.js files using the Express framework.
