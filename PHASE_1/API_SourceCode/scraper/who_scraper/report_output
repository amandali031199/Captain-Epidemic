More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

She developed symptoms on 8 August, was hospitalized with severe respiratory disease on 17 August and died shortly after admission. \nShe is the third confirmed case from this sub-district to be reported in the past week. \nPreliminary findings from the Cikelet investigation \nA team of experts is presently in the Cikelet subdistrict investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases. Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

In a joint resolution, all countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region have declared polio eradication to be an emergency, calling for support in negotiating and establishing access to those children who are currently unreached with polio vaccination.  WHO and UNICEF are committed to work with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict to ensure all Syrian children are vaccinated no matter where they live.    \nIt is anticipated that outbreak response will need to continue for at least six to eight months, depending on the area and based on evolving epidemiology.    \nGiven the current situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, frequent population movements across the region and subnational immunity gaps in key areas, the risk of further spread of wild poliovirus across the region is considered to be high. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases in addition to implementing the recommended supplementary immunization activities with oral polio vaccine.\n      \n\t\t\t\t\nWHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommendations for travelers to and from polio-affected areaspdf, 10.54Mb", "disease": ["Polio"], "event-date": ["8 October 2013"]}]

She developed symptoms on 8 August, was hospitalized with severe respiratory disease on 17 August and died shortly after admission. \nShe is the third confirmed case from this sub-district to be reported in the past week. \nPreliminary findings from the Cikelet investigation \nA team of experts is presently in the Cikelet subdistrict investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases. Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

No further samples have tested positive to date in Brazil, nor have any paralytic polio cases been detected there.\nAccording to the International Health Regulations (IHR) Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director-General of WHO on 5 May 2014, Equatorial Guinea is considered as a polio exporting country. \nThe country is therefore working to ensure that all residents and long-term visitors (of more than 4 weeks) who travel internationally receive a supplementary dose of polio vaccine between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to departure.", "disease": ["Update on polio"], "event-date": ["16 July 2014", "28 January 2014", "3 May 2014"]}]

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

She developed symptoms on 8 August, was hospitalized with severe respiratory disease on 17 August and died shortly after admission. \nShe is the third confirmed case from this sub-district to be reported in the past week. \nPreliminary findings from the Cikelet investigation \nA team of experts is presently in the Cikelet subdistrict investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases. Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

She developed symptoms on 8 August, was hospitalized with severe respiratory disease on 17 August and died shortly after admission. \nShe is the third confirmed case from this sub-district to be reported in the past week. \nPreliminary findings from the Cikelet investigation \nA team of experts is presently in the Cikelet subdistrict investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases. Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

The number of districts affected by the measles outbreak is increasing, and as of 1 March 2020, 15 health districts have been affected: Alindao, Alindao-Mingala, Baboua-Abba, Bambari, Bangui I, Bangui II, Bangui III, B\u00e9goua, Bimbo, Bococaranga-Koui, Boss\u00e9mb\u00e9l\u00e9, Bouar, Bozoum, Haute-Kotto, Nangha-Boguila, Ngaoundaye, and Ouango-Gambo. \nIn December 2019, outbreaks affected eight health districts, and the country organized local measles vaccination campaigns that targeted children aged 6 to 59 months in seven districts (Bambari, Batangafo, Bocaranga-Koui, Grimari-Kouango, K\u00e9mo, Ngaoundaye, and Nana-Gribizi). Despite vaccination coverage of more than 95%, as confirmed by the vaccination coverage survey, new cases are being recorded in these districts and neighboring health districts in children aged from 5 to 15 years old.  Based on the age distribution of cases as indicated by epidemiological investigations, the proposed vaccination strategy is to target the risk group from 6 months to 10 years to help stop transmission.", "disease": ["Measles"], "event-date": ["28 January 2019", "10 February 2020"]}]

She developed symptoms on 8 August, was hospitalized with severe respiratory disease on 17 August and died shortly after admission. \nShe is the third confirmed case from this sub-district to be reported in the past week. \nPreliminary findings from the Cikelet investigation \nA team of experts is presently in the Cikelet subdistrict investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases. Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing. The team is well-supplied with antiviral drugs, and these are being administered prophylactically to close contacts of cases and therapeutically to persons showing symptoms of influenza-like illness.

Two nationwide bOPV campaigns are planned for mid-July 2014 and mid-August 2014; the July 2014 round will target the entire population, and the August 2014 round will target children under 15 years old. \nAs noted in the Disease Outbreak News update published on 25 June 2014, Brazil reported on 18 June 2014 that WPV1 had been detected in a sewage sample collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport in Sao Paulo state, with genetic sequencing indicating that this virus is most closely related to the virus currently circulating in Equatorial Guinea.  No further samples have tested positive to date in Brazil, nor have any paralytic polio cases been detected there.\nAccording to the International Health Regulations (IHR) Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director-General of WHO on 5 May 2014, Equatorial Guinea is considered as a polio exporting country. \nThe country is therefore working to ensure that all residents and long-term visitors (of more than 4 weeks) who travel internationally receive a supplementary dose of polio vaccine between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to departure.", "disease": ["Update on polio"], "event-date": ["16 July 2014", "28 January 2014", "3 May 2014"]}]

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

She developed symptoms on 8 August, was hospitalized with severe respiratory disease on 17 August and died shortly after admission. \nShe is the third confirmed case from this sub-district to be reported in the past week. \nPreliminary findings from the Cikelet investigation \nA team of experts is presently in the Cikelet subdistrict investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases. Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing. The team is well-supplied with antiviral drugs, and these are being administered prophylactically to close contacts of cases and therapeutically to persons showing symptoms of influenza-like illness.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

Many nongovernmental organizations have opened oral rehydration corners to increase the coverage of the population. \nThe most affected places in Monrovia are Central Monrovia, Paynesville and Sinkor. The caseload seems to be decreasing in Paynesville and Sinkor, probably as the result of the widespread chlorination of wells undertaken during the last four weeks by WHO and UNICEF. In Central Monrovia, the low access to safe water and sanitation remains critical and limits the effectiveness of control measures. An increase in cholera cases has also occurred in Buchanan (Grand Bassa County). \nAn additional concern is the increase in bloody diarrhoea cases (141 cases reported during 15-21 September mainly in Central Monrovia and Paynesville) which might be due to shigellosis.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

She developed symptoms on 8 August, was hospitalized with severe respiratory disease on 17 August and died shortly after admission. \nShe is the third confirmed case from this sub-district to be reported in the past week. \nPreliminary findings from the Cikelet investigation \nA team of experts is presently in the Cikelet subdistrict investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases. Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

She developed symptoms on 8 August, was hospitalized with severe respiratory disease on 17 August and died shortly after admission. \nShe is the third confirmed case from this sub-district to be reported in the past week. \nPreliminary findings from the Cikelet investigation \nA team of experts is presently in the Cikelet subdistrict investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases. Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.

The first case of measles was recorded in week 5 of 2019 (week commencing 28 January 2019) and the outbreak has continued through to week 7 of 2020 (week commencing 10 February 2020), with eighteen health districts affected including twelve newly affected in 2020 (Bimbo, B\u00e9goua, Bangui I, Bangui II and Bangui III in the urban area, Boss\u00e9mb\u00e9l\u00e9, Bouar, Bozoum, Baboua-Abba, Haute-Kotto, Nangha-Boguila, and Ouango-Gambo in the rural area).  \nFrom 1 January 2019 through 16 February 2020, a total of 7,626 suspected cases including 83 deaths (case fatality rate 1.08%) were reported. A large proportion of cases (72%) were below five years old and 18% of cases were between 5 and 10 years old. A total of 1,167 samples from suspected cases were tested at the reference laboratory of the Institut Pasteur in Bangui, of which 180 were positive for measles using Immunoglobulin M (IgM).\nThe low vaccination coverage for routine measles vaccine over the past 5 years (below 60% for the first dose at 9 months), the absence of a second measles vaccine dose in the national immunization schedule, and inadequate follow-up campaigns resulted in a high proportion of people susceptible to measles, contributing to the ongoing epidemic.  All 35 health districts are at risk of a measles outbreak, and without adequate response, the epidemic could spread through the entire country. The number of districts affected by the measles outbreak is increasing, and as of 1 March 2020, 15 health districts have been affected: Alindao, Alindao-Mingala, Baboua-Abba, Bambari, Bangui I, Bangui II, Bangui III, B\u00e9goua, Bimbo, Bococaranga-Koui, Boss\u00e9mb\u00e9l\u00e9, Bouar, Bozoum, Haute-Kotto, Nangha-Boguila, Ngaoundaye, and Ouango-Gambo. \nIn December 2019, outbreaks affected eight health districts, and the country organized local measles vaccination campaigns that targeted children aged 6 to 59 months in seven districts (Bambari, Batangafo, Bocaranga-Koui, Grimari-Kouango, K\u00e9mo, Ngaoundaye, and Nana-Gribizi). Despite vaccination coverage of more than 95%, as confirmed by the vaccination coverage survey, new cases are being recorded in these districts and neighboring health districts in children aged from 5 to 15 years old.

Three hamlets are the focus of investigation. \nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback. \nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent. \nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another. \nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. \nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans. \nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing.

More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. \nThe first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. \n Epidemiological surveillance \nSimple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. \nMedical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. \nThe epidemiological information presented below was collected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. \nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. \nResults: \nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). \nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. \nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. \nComment \nThe public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.
