https://teletubbies-who-api.herokuapp.com/


### Functions implemented

The API documentation is available on the first part of the API URL.

The clearly documented API has been deployed as a REST Web service and requests can be made to it. The GET request required allows a client to find and access diseases reports by key terms such as diseases, and locations for a given period of time. These requests can be made to the API using the input format outlined in the project specification and related disease articles are returned with the output format defined as well. The POST, DELETE and PUT requests can also be used by users to edit the information inside the database however these functions can only be accessed by people with the authentication code.

The API has been documented in Swagger and it is callable through the 'Try it' buttons which returns incomplete results. Multiple parameter combinations can also be inputed with the required start and end dates and the optional parameters including the key terms and locations.
