# SENG3011_TeleTubbies

## Deliverable 2

### Part 1 - Swagger documentation and a working API endpoint

### URL for the API
The API can be accessed using the following link
https://teletubbies-who-api.herokuapp.com/


### Functions implemented

The API documentation is available on the first part of the API URL.

The clearly documented API has been deployed as a REST Web service and requests can be made to it. The GET request required allows a client to find and access diseases reports by key terms such as diseases, and locations for a given period of time. These requests can be made to the API using the input format outlined in the project specification and related disease articles are returned with the output format defined as well. 

It should be noted that the data returned is sample data from the WHO website which has been stored within the database and does not include all reports found as the web scraper has not been fully implemented yet. 

The API has been documented in Swagger and it is callable through the 'Try it' buttons which returns incomplete results. Multiple parameter combinations can also be inputed with the required start and end dates and the optional parameters including the key terms and locations.
